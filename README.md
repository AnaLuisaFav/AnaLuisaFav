<h3> ~ About me </h3>
👩🏻‍💻 &nbsp; Passionate about computers since childhood, especially video games! It has always been my favorite hobby.<br>
🎮 &nbsp; What was once just a hobby, became my job: for three years, I worked as a streamer (live content broadcasting) for games.<br>
💻 &nbsp; During that time, I had a brief experience with programming, but it was enough to captivate me and further ignite my interest in the field!<br>
📚 &nbsp; I suspended the streams - as it was a time-consuming job - to pursue my interest in IT. I started a Web Development course and began studying Computer Science, thus becoming a developer and a future systems analyst! - I still play games, but it's back to being just a fun pastime.<br>
🎯 &nbsp; I am currently working as an intern in the quality assurance (tester) field!<br>
<h3> ~ Curiosities </h3>
🦋 &nbsp; Before following the path of technology, I graduated in biology 💚<br>
🐱 &nbsp; I love cats and dogs 🐶
